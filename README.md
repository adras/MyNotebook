# MyNotebook

## Introduction
This will be the successor of my old sourceforce project MyNotebook.

Currently an angular.js frontend is in development. At a later stage the old PHP backend will be replaced 
by something else.

# Sourceforge project
The old sourceforge sourcecode can be found in the backend/php subdirectory. Unfortunately the upgrade process is a bit
cumbersome since the install-script was never upgraded, and the upgrade script only upgrades the database but not the 
config. Anyway, I just installed it successfuly and created the install instructions below.

# Demo
You can find a demo of the old php version MyNotebook-Uranus [here](http://adras.bplaced.net/notes-uranus/)
As long as nobody changed it, the password it `demo`. The database will be reset every hour.

# Demo Angular
Although the angular project is still under development and there's a lot to do, you can check out the current state [here](http://adras.bplaced.net/notes-angular/)
It uses the same backend and therefore the same database as the demo. Password is also `demo`

# Install
To install MyNotebook-Uranus see the install instructions in [install.md](https://github.com/adras/MyNotebook/blob/main/Install.md)
